🎮 HAND HOCKEY DISCORD BOT – GAMEPLAY DESIGN (Prefix: H)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧩 BASIC MECHANICS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- DM-based number guessing game.
- Prefix command: "H"
- Roles: ST (Striker), MF (Midfielder), DEF (Defender), GK (Goalkeeper).
- Attacker vs Defender turns.
- Bot DMs both players asking for a number based on role and scenario.
- If attacker ≠ defender → attacker wins the round.
- Same number → interception, foul, save, etc., depending on role/situation.
- No response = 1 retry; else opponent gets advantage.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 RANGE LOGIC BASED ON ROLE & SCENARIO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- ST vs DEF/MF (Dribbling/Passing) ➝ Range: 1-3
- MF vs DEF (Passing) ➝ Range: 1-3
- ST vs GK (Shooting/Saving) ➝ Range: 1-6
- ST vs MF (Quick Pass) ➝ Range: 1-2
- ST vs DEF (Corner Kick) ➝ Range: 4-6
- GK Interception ➝ Range: 1-3
- Any Off-side call scenario ➝ Random event
- Set pieces like Free hits, Corners, and Penalties → Custom logic

"You're up! Enter your action (1-3) within 15s."

- Example 1:
<Player1> chose: 3  
<Player2> chose: 2  
→ Result:  
"⚡ <Player1> dribbled past <Player2>!"
→ Channel:  
"<Player1>'s last action ➝ 3  
<Player2>'s last action ➝ 2"

- Example 2:
<Player2> didn’t respond  
→ Result:  
"⏳ <Player2>, respond within 10s or risk conceding!"  
(if no response)  
"🚀 <Player1> breaks through! No response from <Player2>."
